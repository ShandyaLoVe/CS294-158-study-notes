# CS294-158: Deep Unsupervised Learning (Spring 2024)

This repository documents my self-study journey through **CS294-158: Deep Unsupervised Learning**, a graduate-level course offered by UC Berkeley in Spring 2024. The official course webpage is available here: [CS294-158 Website](https://sites.google.com/view/berkeley-cs294-158-sp24/home).

## Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Follow the lecture content and assignments of CS294-158.
- Consolidate key concepts and techniques in unsupervised and self-supervised learning.
- Implement selected algorithms and reproduce key results.
- Record and share personal notes, additional references, and insights gathered during the learning process.

## Contents

### üìö Notes
I‚Äôve taken detailed notes while watching lectures and reading associated papers. These are available in the `notes/` directory and are organized by topic or lecture.

Topics include:
- Contrastive learning
- Masked modeling
- Representation learning theory
- Diffusion models
- Generative adversarial networks (GANs)
- Self-supervised learning in vision and language

### üîç References
I consulted various papers and tutorials to supplement the lectures. Some useful references include:
- *A Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations* (SimCLR)
- *Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners* (MAE)
- *Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models*
- Blog posts by Lilian Weng and OpenAI on diffusion and generative models
- PyTorch and JAX implementations of common self-supervised methods

These can be found in the `references/` folder and are cited in my notes.

### üíª Code
The `code/` directory includes selected implementations, reproductions, and experiments based on:
- SimCLR
- BYOL
- MAE
- Basic diffusion models

Some scripts are inspired by open-source implementations but are restructured for learning purposes and clarity. Experiments are done using PyTorch.

## How to Use This Repository

You are welcome to browse the materials here if you are also studying unsupervised learning or following the CS294-158 course independently.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShandyaLoVe/cs294-158-learning.git
